If you want do contribute, just ask. I will not always directly answer, because I am bussy with other things. (It could take days.) This project is purely for fun. Don't take it seriosly. Now to the rules:

1. Don't spam me or others. Write once. I will read it eventually.
2. Don't pressure yourself, to do something, if other wait for it. It is ok if you take months or even years.
3. Don't pressure me or others into finishing something.
4. Don't insult anyone.
5. Talk to others with respect.
6. If you wan't to not contribute anymore, just tell me.
7. I take the right, to kick anyone, who missbehaves or has other aims than just programming for this project. (If that is how ot works)

I don't know how the Copyright stuff works, but I want to release this under my name eventually. (Idk which license). But I wan't that everyone who conbtributet to be named, as I am not alone.
